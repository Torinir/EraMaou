## Game Information

### Project Status
The overhaul is complete, but translation will likely end in favor of the more updated EraMaouEx repository.

### Game Description
This game puts you in the role of a Maou who overlooks their dungeon. You get to lay out the traps, send your own heroes (previous invaders who have tried to invade you but got captured and then corrupted) to intercept and capture invaders or lead an attack on the outside world with either your own magic, your heroes, or your minions.
